# CSGov Theme

Starter theme for CSGov Drupal Distribution.

## Basics

* Theme is dependent on [Design system gov.cz](https://www.drupal.org/projects/gov_cz) module, which provides a gov.cz components as Single Directory Components along with basic styling and variables.
* Theme is using CSS custom properties (variables)
* There is no gulp, or sass, only old "boring" plain CSS.
* CSS is separated in small chunks together with the twig templates and JS in form of small components.

***Happy codding!***
