# CS Gov Theme

Starter theme for CS Gov Distribution.

## Frontend changes

* Theme is using CSS custom properties (variables)
* There is no gulp, or sass, only old "boring" plain CSS.
* CSS is separated in small chunks together with the twig templates and JS in form of small components.
* There is an initial try for a dark mode support.

***Happy codding!***
